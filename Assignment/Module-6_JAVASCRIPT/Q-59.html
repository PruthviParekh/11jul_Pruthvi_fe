    <h3><u>Array vs object defences in JS?</u></h3>
    <pre>
<u>1> Array :</u>

- <u>Ordered Collection :</u> Arrays are ordered collections of elements. Each element in the array has a numeric index starting from 0.

- <u>Access by Index :</u> Elements in an array are accessed using their index. For example, array[0] retrieves the first element of the array.

- <u>Methods and Properties :</u> Arrays come with a variety of built-in methods for common operations like adding, removing, and iterating over<br>  elements (e.g., push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), forEach(), map(), filter(), etc.).

- <u>Use Cases :</u> Arrays are typically used when the order of elements matters or when you need to perform operations on a list of items.

- <u>Syntax :</u> Arrays are defined using square brackets [].

- <u>Example</u>

  &lt;script&gt;
      let array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
      console.log(array)
  &lt;/script&gt;

- <u>Output :</u>

  (4)Â [1, 2, 3, 4]

<u>2> Objects :</u>

- <u>Unordered Collection :</u> Objects are collections of key-value pairs where the keys (also known as properties) are strings (or Symbols),<br>  and the values can be any type.

- <u>Unordered Collection :</u> Objects are collections of key-value pairs where the keys (also known as properties) are strings (or Symbols),<br>  and the values can be any type.

- <u>Methods and Properties :</u> Objects do not have the array-specific methods but come with their own set of methods like Object.keys(),<br>  Object.values(), Object.entries(), and Object.assign() for working with object properties.

- <u>Use Cases :</u> Objects are used when you need to store data as key-value pairs, often to represent real-world entities or structured data<br>  where each key has a specific meaning.

- <u>Syntax :</u> Objects are defined using curly braces {}.

- <u>Example :</u>

  &lt;script&gt;
      let object = {
      key1: 'value1',
      key2: 'value2',
      key3: 'value3'
      };
      console.log(object)
  &lt;/script&gt;

- <u>Output :</u> 

  {key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2', key3: 'value3'}
