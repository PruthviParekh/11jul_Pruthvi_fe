    <h3><u>What is a Loop and Switch Case in JavaScript define that ?</u></h3>
    <pre>
1> Loop in JavaScript:

- A loop in JavaScript is a programming structure that repeats a block of code multiple times until a specified condition is met. There<br>  are several types of loops in JavaScript:

- For Loop: Executes a block of code a specified number of times.

- <u>Example :</u> for (initialization; condition; iteration)
            {
                // code block to be executed
            }

2> While Loop: Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

- <u>Example :</u> while (condition)
            {
                // code block to be executed
            }

3> Do-While Loop: Similar to the while loop, but it executes the code block once before checking the condition.

- <u>Example :</u> do
            {
                // code block to be executed
            } while (condition);

4> Switch-Case : The switch statement in JavaScript provides a way to execute different blocks of code based on different conditions. It<br>   is often used as an alternative to long chains of if...else if...else statements when you need to compare a single variable against<br>   multiple possible values.

- <u>Example :</u> switch (expression)
            {
                case value1:
                    // code block executed if expression === value1
                    break;
                case value2:
                    // code block executed if expression === value2
                    break;
                default:
                    // code block executed if expression does not match any case
            }
