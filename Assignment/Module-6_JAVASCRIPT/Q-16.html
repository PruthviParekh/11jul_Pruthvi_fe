    <h3><u>What is the result of the expression (true && 1 && "hello")?</u></h3>
    <pre>
- In JavaScript, the logical AND (`&&`) operator evaluates expressions from left to right and returns the first falsy value it encounters, or the last value if all expressions are truthy.

- Let's break down the expression `(true && 1 && "hello")`:
        
- `true` is a truthy value.
- `1` is also a truthy value.
- `"hello"` is a non-empty string, which is also a truthy value.
        
- Since all expressions in the chain are truthy, the logical AND operator returns the last value it evaluates, which is `"hello"`.
        
- Therefore, the result of the expression `(true && 1 && "hello")` is `"hello"`.
