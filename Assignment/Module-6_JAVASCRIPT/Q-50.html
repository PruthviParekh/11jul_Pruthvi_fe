    <h3><u>What is the drawback of declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects?</u></h3>
    <pre>
<u>1>  Memory Usage :</u>

- Every object instance gets its own copy of each method. If you have many instances of an object, this can lead to higher memory usage<br>  compared to using prototypes where methods are shared among all instances.

<u>2>  Performance Impact :</u>

- Directly declared methods may impact performance, especially in scenarios where you have many instances or frequent method calls.<br>  Prototype methods can be more optimized by the JavaScript engine.

<u>3> Difficulty in Managing Updates :</u>

- If you need to update or extend the behavior of an object's methods after creation, you would have to update each instance individually.<br>  This can lead to code duplication and maintenance issues.

<u>4> No Encapsulation :</u>

- Methods declared directly in objects do not provide encapsulation or private members. All properties and methods are publicly accessible<br>  , which can lead to potential issues with data integrity or accidental overwriting.

<u>5> Prototypal Inheritance Limitations :</u>

- If you later decide to refactor your code to use inheritance (prototypal inheritance in JavaScript), methods directly declared in<br>  objects may not integrate well with inherited behavior, as they are not part of the prototype chain.

        let person = {
            firstName: 'John',
            lastName: 'Doe',
            fullName: function () {
                return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
            }
        };

        console.log(person.fullName()); // Outputs: "John Doe"

    </script>
