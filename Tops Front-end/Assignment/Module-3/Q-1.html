    <h3><u>Q-1. Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?</u></h3>

    <p>
        - No, The Html tags and elements are not the same thing.<br>
        - Because, HTML Tags are building blocks of HTML Page and HTML Elements are components that are used in HTML Page.<br>
        - When the Start tag, Content, and End tag are combined, then it is called an Element.<br>
        - The size of an Element is same as the Content.
        - There is two types of Elements.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;1>Inline Level Element<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;2>Block Level Element
