        <p>Tim Berners-Lee was born on June 8, 1955 and grew up in London. He studied physics at Oxford University and later became a software engineer.<br>
        Berners-Lee first described the concept of a global system, based on the concept of â€˜hypertext which would allow researchers everywhere to share information in 1980. He built<br> a prototype called â€˜Enquireâ€™. In 1984, he published a paper called â€˜Information Management: A Proposalâ€™ in which he created a system for sharing and distributing<br> information globally. He named it the World Wide Web. First website was created in 1991. You can visit the website here:

        In 1994, Berners Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Laboratory of Computer Science (LCS) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston.<br>
        Currently, he is director of the World Wide Web Consortium that he founded and a Professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Oxford.
